simpleChess
===

This project was inspired by a Chessboard to be found at [opensofias/vaporchess](https://github.com/opensofias/vaporchess).

Together with the need for a project to demo react + redux on I decided
to try implementing a subset of chess functionality as a single page application.

Usage with yarn
---

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a cool package manager for JavaScript.
This project makes use of it to install dependencies, run tests and checks
and start the development server.
Here are some commands:

| Command        | Effect                 |
| :------------- | :--------------------- |
| `yarn install` | Install dependencies   |
| `yarn lint`    | Run linter             |
| `yarn flow`    | Run flow typechecker   |
| `yarn test`    | Run jest tests         |
| `yarn start`   | Run development server |

Usage with npm

In case that you'd like to use npm instead of yarn all should work well.
You can use similar commands to yarn:

| yarn           | npm             |
| :------------- | :-------------- |
| `yarn install` | `npm install`   |
| `yarn lint`    | `npm run lint`  |
| `yarn test`    | `npm test`      |
| `yarn start`   | `npm start`     |
